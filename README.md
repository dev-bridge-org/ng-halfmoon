# NgHalfmoon
This is the workspace for the angular-libary of [halfmoon](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/).
Here we will be adding angular-components and other utilities to help you develop apps with the halfmoon-framework.

The credits go to the maintainers and contributors of halfmoon because without it this wouldn't be possible.

[Here](https://nostalgic-thompson-e79979.netlify.app/) you can find the current documentation.

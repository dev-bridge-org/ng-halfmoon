# Contributing to NG-Halfmoon

## What is the target?
Due to the fact that this is a angular-library for the halfmoon-framework the target is to build easy to use components and utilities for the users who want to include halfmoon in their angular-project.

## Issues
If there is anything wrong with one of the components or utilities then make sure to add a issue.

You shouldn't always create an issue if it is a personal-bug therefore you can contact us at <e-mail>.

Please make sure you have a link to either a repository, or a stackblitz where you have reproduced the issue.
This is important that we can debug why the error is happening. If you already know where the bug appears then you can add it to your issue, and we will fix it.
Some bugs might be fixed asap, some might take longer due to priority.

## Pull Requests
Before you implement some functionalities please contact us because it might be possible that someone is already working on it.
That reduces the risk of unnecessary time-loss of yourself, and also we can find something for you if you want to contribute.

Please make sure if you are implementing functionality then always add tests to make sure it is working as supposed.
If you need help then you can contact us we will give you the support for it.

If it is implemented then you can create the PR explain in words what you have done.
We will then review it and accept it or give you some improvement-ideas.
